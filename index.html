                    1. A Professional Follows The Latest Market Trends
                </h2>

                <br>
                <p>
                    With higher mortgage rates and moderating buyer demand, conditions are changing and staying on top of the latest market information is crucial when you sell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working with an expert real estate advisor helps ensure you can stay updated on what’s happening. They know your local area and follow national trends too. More importantly, they’ll know what this data means for you, and as the market shifts, they’ll be able to help you navigate it and make your best decision.

                    2. A Professional Helps Maximize Your Pool Of Buyers
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Your agent’s role in bringing in buyers is important. Real estate professionals have a large variety of tools at their disposal, such as social media followers, agency resources, and the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) to ensure your house is viewed by the most buyers. Investopedia <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/071514/8-reasons-not-sell-your-home-without-agent.asp#toc-4-agents-access-large-networks">explains</a> why it’s risky to sell on your own without the network an agent provides:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You don’t have relationships with clients, other agents, or a real estate agency to bring the largest pool of potential buyers to your home. A smaller pool of potential buyers means less demand for your property, which can translate into waiting longer to sell your home and possibly not getting as much money as your house is worth.”
                </p>

                    3. A Professional Understands The Fine Print
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today, more disclosures and regulations are mandatory when selling a house. That means the number of legal documents you’ll need to juggle is growing. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) explains it best, <a href="https://magazine.realtor/sales-and-marketing/handouts-for-customers/for-sellers/8-reasons-to-work-with-a-realtor">saying</a>:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Selling a home typically requires a variety of forms, reports, disclosures, and other legal and financial documents. . . . Also, there’s a lot of jargon involved in a real estate transaction; you want to work with a professional who can speak the language.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    A real estate professional knows exactly what needs to happen, what all the fine print means, and how to work through it efficiently. They’ll help you review the documents and avoid any costly missteps that could occur if you try to handle them on your own.

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">
                    4. A Professional Is A Trained Negotiator
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If you sell without a professional, you’ll also be solely responsible for all the negotiations. That means you’ll have to coordinate with:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The buyer, who wants the best deal possible
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The buyer’s agent, who will use their expertise to advocate for the buyer
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The inspection company, which works for the buyer and will almost always find concerns with the house
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The appraiser, who assesses the property’s value to protect the lender
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In today’s changing market, buyers are regaining some negotiation power as bidding wars ease. Instead of going toe-to-toe with all the above parties alone, lean on an expert. They’ll know what levers to pull, how to address everyone’s concerns, and when you may want to get a second opinion.

                    5. A Professional Knows How To Set The Right Price For Your House
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If you sell your house on your own, you may be more likely to overshoot your asking price. That could mean your house will sit on the market because you priced it too high for where the market is now. Today, pricing a house requires even more expertise to ensure you get it right. NAR <a href="https://magazine.realtor/sales-and-marketing/handouts-for-customers/for-sellers/8-reasons-to-work-with-a-realtor">explains</a> it like this:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “A great real estate agent will look at your home with an unbiased eye, providing you with the information you need to enhance marketability and maximize price.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Real estate professionals know the ins and outs of how to price your house accurately and competitively. To do so, they compare your house to recently sold homes in your area and factor in the current condition of your home. These steps are key to making sure it’s set to move quickly while still getting you the highest possible final sale price.

                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Whether it’s following local and national trends and guiding you through a shifting market or pricing your house right, a real estate agent has essential insights you’ll want to rely on throughout the transaction. Don’t go at it alone.  If you plan to sell your house, let’s connect.
